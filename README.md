# CBCT-to-CT

This project is code for deep learning-based CBCT-to-CT translation, implemented in PyTorch using flow matching models and denoising diffusion probabilistic models.

The project includes three sections: 1) Generating simulated CBCT from CT according to the CBCT imaging procedure, 2) CBCT-to-CT conversion using deep learning, and 3) Assessment of model performance.

# How to run the code

The code for each section can be run independently. After modifying configuration parameters such as file paths, directly run main.py in the src folder.
